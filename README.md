### BIO:
I am software engineer with knowledge in React, React-Native, Javascript, Python, Node js, MongoDB, HTML, and CSS. I come from a  background in customer service and marketing. I have done many odd jobs that has given me the ability to speak to any and everyone about almost anything allowing me to connect with team members as well as clients fairly easy. I am a loving husband and father of 1. They are my motivation for everything.
