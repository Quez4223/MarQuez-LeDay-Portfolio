BIO:
I am software engineer with knowledge in React, React-Native, Javascript, Python, Node js, MongoDB, HTML, and CSS. I come from a  background in customer service and marketing. I have done many odd jobs that has given me the ability to speak to any and everyone about almost anything allowing me to connect with team members as well as clients fairly easy. I am a loving husband and father of 1. They are my motivation for everything.

This was my third project and by far my favorite one to work on. It was my first project done in a group. I had learned a lot and had a great team. WAQ Vinyl is an app for those who collect vinyl records and wanted to have a digital log of there collection. This was made using React and Javascript.
